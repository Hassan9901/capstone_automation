## 1. Abstract

A centralized platform for final year projects is needed to address several challenges faced by students. Currently, there is no system for students to access information about past projects, collaborate with peers, find group members, or receive feedback on project ideas. Our proposed website provides a comprehensive solution, making the FYP experience more efficient and manageable for students, supervisors, and administrators alike.

---

## 2. Background & Justification

Final year projects are a vital part of a student’s academic journey, enabling them to apply their knowledge and skills. However, the FYP process is often fragmented:
- Past project info is not easily accessible, limiting inspiration.
- Proposal submission is bureaucratic and slow.
- Finding the right supervisor or group members is challenging.
- Collaboration tools are lacking.

**Our Solution:**  
We digitize previous FYP records, making them searchable and accessible online. Students can submit proposals, discover past projects, collaborate, and get feedback without paperwork or physical meetings. Supervisors and admins gain efficient tools for managing and reviewing FYPs, driving innovation and success.

## 3. Project Scope

- 🔐 Student registration and login via GIFT ID  
- 📁 Search & browse past FYPs  
- 🔎 Find students by interest, name, or department  
- 💬 Student feed for sharing ideas and connecting  
- 👤 Student profiling  
- 🤖 Recommender system for ideas and groups  
- 📤 Online proposal submission  
- 🚫 Duplicate proposal detection  
- 🛠️ Admin and supervisor interfaces
